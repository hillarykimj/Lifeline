<p style="font-family:helvetica;">If you witness a cardiac arrest, it’s crucial to call 999 and start CPR immediately.
If you come across someone who is unconscious check for a response 
<br>– gently shake the person’s shoulders and ask loudly 'are you alright?'.</br>
<br>Someone having a cardiac arrest  won’t be breathing normally or be conscious.</br>
<br>Keeping their head back check for regular chest movements feeling for breath on your cheek.</br>
<br>If the person is not breathing or not breathing normally call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. </br></p>
